# Deep Learning w/ Python

Workspace based on the book "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet.

Tools used:
* [Keras](https://keras.io)
* [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org)

Doing this on Colaboratory so far. [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JqG44u0J11_jzoT_S4lj9RLqLHhlD12y?usp=sharing)

Addtionally to using the Colaboratory linked above, I will keep a copy of the
python notebook in this repository.
